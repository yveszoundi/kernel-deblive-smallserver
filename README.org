/tl;dr Smaller kernel image for server-centric Debian-based Live CDs. This is NOT for Desktop systems./

* What is this?

** Overview

This is a set of /minimal/ Debian kernel images for Live CDs, with a *focus on server systems*.
- The target kernel versions are [[https://kernel.org/category/releases.html][longterm release kernels]]
  - Only versions that compile without a proliferation of configuration files are considered
  - There will be occasionally other releases for bleeding edge versions
- This is for both =amd64= and =aarch64= architectures  
- Drivers for audio, video or other "non-meaningful" settings are discarded
- The resulting kernel image installation size should be as small as possible

** Main goals

- The system should be able to successfully boot from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFI][UEFI]] or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS][BIOS]] mode on most machines
- The system should successfully power off without hanging
- The system should support "containerization" (=podman=, =docker=, etc.)
- The system should support =iptables= for firewall settings
- The system should support popular file-systems used in Live CDs such as =squashfs=
- The system Live media size should be reduced significantly with provided kernel packages

** Initial use-case

The first use-case for this repository is supporting the Live CD creation of a document sanitizer tool ([[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/entrusted/][Entrusted]]).

* How was the configuration defined?

- Start with an Ubuntu kernel configuration in your =/boot= folder
- Compare settings with the [[https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Kernels][Alpine Linux virt-flavor]] kernel configuration
- Remove as many settings as possible, while testing few Live CDs for =arm64= and =amd64=
- Stop removing settings when it becomes too cumbersome to test
    
* What is available?

Please visit the [[https://github.com/yveszoundi/kernel-deblive-smallserver/releases][releases page]] for downloads (64-bit: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64][amd64/x86_64]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AArch64][arm64/aarch64]]).

The zip archive for each architecture (=amd64= or =arm64=) contains 3 Debian packages:

|------------------+-------------------------------------------------|
| Package          | Description                                     |
|------------------+-------------------------------------------------|
| =linux-headers=  | Linux kernel headers                            |
| =linux-image=    | Linux kernel                                    |
| =linux-libc-dev= | Linux support headers for userspace development |
|------------------+-------------------------------------------------|

The =arm64= kernel packages are created via cross-compilation.
