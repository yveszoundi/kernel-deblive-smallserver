#+TITLE: README

* What is this?

** Overview

The goal is to produce minimal Debian kernel images for Live CDs, with a **focus on server systems**.
- The target kernel version is the latest stable release from https://kernel.org
- This is for both =amd64= and =aarch64= architectures  
- Sound drivers, deprecated or "non-meaningful" settings are discarded from the kernel configuration

** Main objectives

- The system should be able to successfully boot from =UEFI= or =BIOS= mode on most machines
- The system should successfully power off without hanging
- The system should support containerization
- The system should support =iptables=
- The system should support popular file-systems used in Live CDs such as =squashfs=

** Initial use-case

The first use-case for this repository is supporting the Live CD creation of a document sanitizer tool ([[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/entrusted/][Entrusted]]).
- It takes a while to compile a kernel for each build
- Compiling for arm64 under amd64 takes even longer to compile (via =QEMU=)
