#+TITLE: README

* What is this?

** Overview

This repository provides Debian packages for Linux kernel images (=amd64= and =arm64=).

The goal is to produce /very/ minimal kernel images for Live CDs, with a focus on server systems.
- The target kernel version is the latest stable release from https://kernel.org
- Audio drivers and such are disregarded

** Main objectives

- The system should be able to successfully boot from =UEFI= or =BIOS= mode on most machines
- The system should successfully power off without hanging
- The system should provide modules/features required by container solutions (=podman=, =docker=, etc.)  
- The system should support =iptables=
- The system should support popular common file-systems used in Live CDs (=squashfs=, etc.)

** Initial use-case

The first use-case for this repository is supporting the Live CD creation of a document sanitizer tool ([[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/entrusted/][Entrusted]]).
